# DFA ToDo Project

ToDo project from William S Vincent's book, Django for APIs v4.0. I've updated with more up to date versions of the key packages; Django, Django Rest Framework and Whitenoise.

Project contains basic ToDo model and a basic REST api that exposes two end points: one that lists all ToDo's and another that returns a specific ToDo that matches the requested PK.
